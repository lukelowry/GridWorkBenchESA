Examples
========
For your convenience, several ESA usage examples are provided in this
section. Some examples may also be presented earlier in the
documentation. If you would like to share your own examples with us,
please file an issue on `GitHub
<https://github.com/mzy2240/ESA/issues>`__. If you'd like even more
examples (though in a *much* less reader friendly format), check out
ESA's `tests <https://github.com/mzy2240/ESA/tree/master/tests>`__,
specifically the ``test_saw.py`` file.
