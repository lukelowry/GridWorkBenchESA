The primary purpose of this fork is to add syntax sugar to 
the excellent python interface that ESA created.

ESA a "Pip-installable" Python package that eases 
interaction with
the PowerWorld Simulator Automation Server (SimAuto). PowerWorld
Simulator is a powerful, commercial-grade electric grid simulation tool
with a wide range of capabilities. Information on Simulator can be found
`here
<https://www.powerworld.com/products/simulator/overview>`__ and
information on SimAuto can be found `here
<https://www.powerworld.com/products/simulator/add-ons-2/simauto>`__.
Since ESA directly interfaces with SimAuto, ESA users will need a
PowerWorld license and installation that also includes SimAuto.
