API Documentation
#######################

I developed this package because I was tired of switching between 3 different application screens to 
develop advanced programs in ESA. At the time I was new to PowerWorld, so I had to reference the object field 
excel sheet every 5 minutes. I found my self wanting more direct control over the data stuctures, even at 
the cost of additional overhead.

If you are very comfortable with ESA, please continue using it for research. It is safer to use, and well maintained.
If you find yourself struggling with the disconnect between ESA and full PowerWorld, give GridWorkbench a try!

The ``gridwb`` package was created to use pandas and numpy-like indexing to interface with power world.
The learning curve can be high, but once understood there is no going back.
